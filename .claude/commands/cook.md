#$ARGUMENTS

## ‚ö° MANDATORY EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### Step 1: Initial Analysis & Planning
1. **TodoWrite** - Capture assignment as initial todos
2. **Determine Phase** - New feature (create phase-id) or continuation?
3. **Discovery Batch** (if complex/new):
   - Launch Research/Architect/BA as appropriate
   - Wait for knowledge foundation
4. **Planning Batch**:
   - Launch Planner with phase decision
   - Planner creates phase-id dir if new

### Step 2: Orchestration Strategy
1. **Consult Agent-Orchestrator** - ALWAYS after planning
   - Provide: Assignment, todos, planner output, file inventory
   - Receive: Dependency analysis, batch sequence, warnings
2. **THINK HARD** about advisor recommendations:
   - File conflicts identified?
   - Dependencies mapped correctly?
   - Verification separated from implementation?
3. **Refine Todos** based on advisor feedback

### Step 3: Batch Execution Loop

**REPEAT UNTIL COMPLETE:**

1. **Agent Batch** (SIMULTANEOUS Task calls):

2. **Agent-Orchestrator + Gatekeeper Batch** - MANDATORY after EVERY Agent batch:
   - Provide Agent-Orchestrator: Assignment, agent responses, updated todos
   - Multiple gatekeepers OK (different focus areas)
   - Receive: Next batch composition, risk warnings, verification status
   
3. **Rework/refine Todos** - Based on feedback from Agent-Orchestrator + Gatekeeper:

**Continue** Batch Execution Loop until assignment verified complete

## üéØ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES

### Dependency Laws
‚ö° **NEVER** batch gatekeepers with implementation
‚ö° **NEVER** assign multiple agents to edit the same file
‚ö° **ALWAYS** planner after research/architecture
‚ö° **ALWAYS** verification after implementation

### Agent Instructions Template
```
"Your name is [FirstNameLastName].

SCOPE: [Project-level | Phase-level (phase-id: XX-Name)]
PHASE DIR: docs/project/phases/[phase-id]/

TEAM ROLE: You are the [role] in a team
COLLABORATING WITH: [List other agents]

COLABORATE:
- [provide support OR leverage what to team members] 
- [Broadcast what information under what conditions]

CONTEXT:
- background context, team objective, broader lense
- [filepath] - [one sentence relevance per file]


YOUR TASK: [Specific deliverable]
SUCCESS CRITERIA: [Clear completion metrics]

[FirstNameLastName], adopt ü§ù TEAMWORK to achieve maximum value delivered."
```

### Batch Composition Goals
- **Minimum**: 5 agents per implementation batch
- **Target**: 8-10 agents including support roles
- **Include**: Architect/Researcher for guidance
- **Follow with**: Verification batch always

### Phase Management
**New Feature Indicators**: Major functionality, no thread context
‚Üí Create phase-id: `XX-DescriptiveName` (e.g., `03-UserAuth`)

**Continuation Indicators**: Bug fix, refinement, existing thread
‚Üí Use existing phase or project-level(for project level scope)

## üìã Standard Workflow Patterns

### New Feature
1. Research/Architect/BA ‚Üí 2. Planner (new phase) ‚Üí 3. Agent-Orch consult ‚Üí
4. Massive implementation batch ‚Üí 5. Multi-gatekeeper verification ‚Üí 6. Done

### Bug Fix  
1. Engineer investigate ‚Üí 2. Planner (existing phase) ‚Üí 3. Agent-Orch consult ‚Üí
4. Fix batch (separate files) ‚Üí 5. Gatekeeper verify ‚Üí 6. Done

### Architecture Change
1. Research/Architect ‚Üí 2. Planner/BA ‚Üí 3. Agent-Orch consult ‚Üí
4. Multi-engineer migration ‚Üí 5. Multi-gatekeeper verify ‚Üí 6. Done

## üî¥ FINAL DIRECTIVES

**DO NOT STOP** until assignment is complete and verified

**Batch** ‚Üí **Agent-Orchestrator + Gatekeeper** ‚Üí **Refine Todos** ‚Üí **Repeat**

**Think about dependencies** - logical, functional, file, verification, knowledge

**Maximize parallelization** - more agents, clear file ownership

**Phase-id format**: `XX-DescriptiveName` for new features

## üö® CRITICAL: Response Protocol

### NEVER respond with status updates
### ONLY respond when assignment is COMPLETE and VERIFIED
### Continue orchestrating batches until DONE
