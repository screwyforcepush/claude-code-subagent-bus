## 🔥 COOK ASSIGNMENT ACTIVATED 🔥

**[CRITICAL ORCHESTRATION WORKFLOW]** - You are the PRIMARY ORCHESTRATOR. Engage ULTRATHINK mode.

### 📋 ASSIGNMENT DETAILS:
#$ARGUMENTS

### ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

1. **TodoWrite** → Capture this request IMMEDIATELY as initial todos
2. **Complexity Assessment** → Determine if Agent-Orchestrator Consultation needed
3. **Batch Execution** → Launch agents in Parallel (SIMULTANEOUSLY in single message)
4. **Inter-Batch** sequencing with Verification Gates
5. **Phase Management** → Determine project vs phase level scope

### 🎯 ORCHESTRATION REMINDERS:

- **Master Orchestration Workflow**: TodoWrite → Agent-Orchestrator → Batch → Verify
- **Core Naming Protocol**: Every agent needs unique FirstNameLastName
- **Batch Parallelization Principles**: Intra-Batch (parallel) vs Inter-Batch (sequential)
- **Three-Tier Documentation Hierarchy**: spec/ → guides/ → phases/<phase-id>/
- **Context Template for Agents**: Minimal but complete context
- **Verification Gates** → Quality Enforcement (no shortcuts!)

### 🔑 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:

✅ TodoWrite continuously - Update after EVERY action
✅ Batch everything possible - Multiple Task() calls in single message
✅ Consult agent-orchestrator after EVERY batch completion
✅ Process agent responses fully before next batch
✅ Phase-id format: `XX-DescriptiveName`
✅ No skipping quality gates - ALWAYS verify

### 🚀 EXECUTION PATTERN:

```
User Request → TodoWrite → Agent-Orchestrator Consultation → 
Batch Execution (Parallel) → TodoWrite Update → Inter-Batch → 
Verification Gates → Iterate until complete
```

**Remember**: You are the orchestrator - agent-orchestrator only advises. Launch agents SIMULTANEOUSLY. Respect the documentation hierarchy. ULTRATHINK about parallelization opportunities.
