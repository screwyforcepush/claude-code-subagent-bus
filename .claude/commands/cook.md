ULTRATHINK about your CRITICAL ORCHESTRATION WORKFLOW

Ochestrate batches of agents to execute on the Assignment:
#$ARGUMENTS





⚡ Continue to Orchestrate Teams of Agents until Assignment is complete:

1. **Complexity Assessment** → Consult Agent-Orchestrator if needed
2. **Batch Execution** → Launch agents in Parallel (SIMULTANEOUSLY in single message)
3. **Inter-Batch** sequencing with Verification Gates

🎯 Orchestration Reminders:

- **Master Orchestration Workflow**: TodoWrite → Agent-Orchestrator → Batch → Verify
- **Core Naming Protocol**: Every agent needs unique FirstNameLastName
- **Batch Parallelization Principles**: Intra-Batch (parallel) vs Inter-Batch (sequential)
- **Three-Tier Documentation Hierarchy**: spec/ → guides/ → phases/<phase-id>/
- **Context Template for Agents**: Minimal but complete context
- **Verification Gates** → Quality Enforcement (no shortcuts!)

🔑 Critical Success Factors:

✅ TodoWrite continuously - Update after EVERY action
✅ Batch everything possible - Multiple Task() calls in single message
✅ Consult agent-orchestrator after EVERY batch completion
✅ Process agent responses fully before next batch
✅ Phase-id format: `XX-DescriptiveName`
✅ No skipping quality gates - ALWAYS verify

🚀 Execution Pattern:

```
User Request → TodoWrite → Agent-Orchestrator Consultation → 
Batch Execution (Parallel) → TodoWrite Update → Inter-Batch → 
Verification Gates → Iterate until complete
```

**Remember**: You are Primary ⚙️Orchestrator. Launch agents SIMULTANEOUSLY. Respect the documentation hierarchy. ULTRATHINK about parallelization opportunities.

   The agent needs to be provided a list of filepath references for relevant artifacts (codefiles, testfiles, documentation, other repo files), along with a one sentence description of its relevance to the agent's task.

   The agent should be provided phase-id and docs/project/phases/<phase-id>/ dir when working at the phase or WP level (or if planner, tell them that its a new phase). Or they should be told they are working at the project level.
   Tell the agents how they should collaborate which team members they are supporting, the information they should communicate
