spin up 10 concurrent meta-agent-builder to create the core team of agents. 
Task each meta-agent-builder with a different agent to update in the existing .claude/agents/core/ dir


REMEMBER: the meta-agent-builder is building the agent, not tasking the agent. give each the meta-agent-builder a name, but dont tell them to give the they are creating a name
