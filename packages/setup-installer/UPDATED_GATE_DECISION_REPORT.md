- **JackMatrix**: Verified package publication and functionality
- **Collaboration**: Effective emergency response to unblock users

## Conclusion

**ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE WITH CONDITIONS**

The claude-comms package installation bug has been successfully fixed and deployed. Version 1.0.2 is live on npm and installs the complete .claude directory structure as required.

**Key Achievement**: Users can now successfully install the complete Claude Code hooks and multi-agent orchestration system using:
```bash
npx claude-comms@1.0.2
```

The assignment objective has been met, and the production bug is resolved.
