# Phase 01: Tree-Sitter Repository Map Implementation

## Phase Overview

**Phase ID:** 01-TreeSitterRepoMap
**Phase Type:** Feature Implementation
**Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)

## Executive Summary

This phase implements a tree-sitter based repository map system for the Claude Code hooks multi-agent observability platform. The system will provide intelligent code context through AST parsing, PageRank-based importance ranking, and token-optimized map generation that seamlessly integrates with the existing UserPromptSubmit hook.

## Phase Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. Replace the TODO placeholder in `.claude/hooks/context/repo_map.py` with a fully functional tree-sitter based implementation
2. Provide context-aware repository maps that fit within Claude's token limits
3. Enable multi-language support through tree-sitter grammars
4. Implement high-performance caching for responsive user experience
5. Integrate seamlessly with existing hook infrastructure

### Secondary Objectives
1. Create comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
2. Document implementation patterns for future extensions
3. Establish performance benchmarks for large codebases
4. Provide fallback mechanisms for unsupported languages

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Criteria
- [ ] Tree-sitter parsing works for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java
- [ ] Repository map generates within 5 seconds for 1000+ file codebases
- [ ] Token optimization keeps maps within configured limits (default 1024)
- [ ] PageRank algorithm correctly identifies important code elements
- [ ] Cache invalidation works correctly on file modifications
- [ ] Hook integration provides context on every user prompt
- [ ] Graceful fallback for unsupported languages

### Performance Criteria
