  pygments: ">=2.17.0"
```

### System Dependencies
```yaml

  - SQLite: ">=3.35"
  - Git: "For repository access"
  - File System: "Read access to codebase"

  - Storage: ">=100MB for cache"
```

```

## Parallelization Opportunities

### Maximum Parallel Execution
```
Batch 1: 4 agents parallel (18 hours total, 6 hours wall time)
Batch 2: 5 agents parallel (36 hours total, 8 hours wall time)
Batch 3: Sequential only (16 hours total, 16 hours wall time)
Batch 4: 3 agents parallel (20 hours total, 8 hours wall time)
Batch 5: Sequential only (12 hours total, 12 hours wall time)

Total: 102 hours effort, ~50 hours wall time with parallelization
Efficiency: 51% time reduction through parallelization
```

### Parallelization Constraints
1. **Batch 1**: Fully parallelizable, no constraints
2. **Batch 2**: Parallel with careful file separation
3. **Batch 3**: Must be sequential due to integration
4. **Batch 4**: Can start once dependencies met
5. **Batch 5**: Strictly sequential for quality control

## Risk Dependencies

### High-Risk Dependencies
| Dependency | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|------|--------|------------|
| tree-sitter libraries | Version conflicts | High | Lock versions, test early |
| WP-2.1 â†’ WP-3.1 | Parser failures | High | Fallback mechanisms |
| WP-3.2 completion | Deployment blocker | High | Early integration testing |
| External API changes | Breaking changes | Medium | Version pinning |

### Circular Dependencies
**None identified** - The dependency graph is acyclic (DAG)

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Fast-Track Options
- Start WP-4.1 unit tests during Batch 2 development
- Begin WP-4.3 documentation as modules complete
- Overlap WP-3.3 performance optimization with WP-4.2 testing

### 2. Batch Compression
- Combine WP-1.1 and WP-1.2 if same engineer has both skills
- Merge WP-3.2 and WP-3.3 for experienced integrator
- Consolidate WP-5.2 and WP-5.3 for faster deployment

### 3. Dependency Reduction
- Create module interfaces early to reduce coupling
- Use mocks for testing to start WP-4.1 earlier
- Implement feature flags for incremental rollout

## Dependency Validation Checklist

### Pre-Batch Validation
- [ ] Batch 1: Development environment ready
- [ ] Batch 2: All Batch 1 outputs available
- [ ] Batch 3: Core modules tested and stable
- [ ] Batch 4: Integration layer functional
- [ ] Batch 5: All tests passing

### Inter-Batch Handoffs
- [ ] WP-1.2 â†’ WP-2.1: Grammar files complete
- [ ] WP-1.3 â†’ WP-2.2/2.3: Algorithms validated
- [ ] WP-2.x â†’ WP-3.1: Modules integrated
- [ ] WP-3.x â†’ WP-4.2: System testable
- [ ] WP-4.x â†’ WP-5.1: Quality metrics met

## Monitoring and Tracking

### Dependency Status Indicators
```
ðŸŸ¢ Green: Dependency satisfied, work can proceed
ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Dependency partially met, limited progress possible
ðŸ”´ Red: Dependency blocked, work cannot start
âšª Gray: Future dependency, not yet relevant
```

### Current Status (Planning Phase)
```
All dependencies: âšª Gray (Not started)
```

### Daily Dependency Review Points
1. Morning: Check overnight completions
2. Midday: Validate parallel work progress
3. Evening: Confirm handoffs for next day

## Contingency Plans

### If Critical Path Delayed
1. **WP-1.2 delayed**: Start with Python only, add languages later
2. **WP-2.1 delayed**: Focus on WP-2.2/2.3 optimization
3. **WP-3.1 delayed**: Extend testing phase preparation
4. **WP-5.1 delayed**: Prepare soft launch with feature flags

### If Dependencies Fail
1. **tree-sitter unavailable**: Implement regex-based fallback
2. **NetworkX issues**: Use simple ranking algorithm
3. **Cache system fails**: Deploy without caching initially
4. **Integration blocked**: Use standalone CLI version
