## Risk Management

### Daily Risk Assessment
Each standup includes risk check:
1. Are we on track for daily goals?
2. Any blocking dependencies?
3. Any technical surprises?
4. Need for scope adjustment?

### Contingency Plans

| Risk | Trigger | Contingency |
|------|---------|-------------|
| API performance issues | Query >200ms | Add more aggressive caching |
| Large dataset handling | UI lag with 1000+ events | Implement pagination fallback |
| Integration delays | Missed Day 3 checkpoint | Reduce scope to core features |
| Browser compatibility | Issues in Safari | Provide degraded experience |
| Team member absence | Unexpected leave | Redistribute WPs to available team |
