# Phase 05: Session Introspection View

**Phase ID:** 05-SessionIntrospect  
**Created:** 2025-08-20  
**Status:** Planning  
**Duration Estimate:** 5-7 days  
**Priority:** High  

## Phase Objectives

Implement a comprehensive Session Introspection View feature that enables visual inspection and analysis of completed Claude Code sessions through the event stream data. This feature will provide deep insights into orchestrator behavior, agent execution patterns, and inter-agent communication flows.

## Business Value

- **Enhanced Debugging**: Enable developers to understand orchestrator decision-making and agent behavior patterns
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities in multi-agent workflows
- **Quality Assurance**: Verify correct agent orchestration and communication patterns
- **Learning Tool**: Understand how Claude Code orchestrates complex tasks through agent collaboration

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. ✅ Users can select a session from a dropdown to view its complete event history
2. ✅ Visual timeline displays orchestrator prompts and agent task assignments chronologically
3. ✅ Each agent's lifecycle is clearly visible with start/completion markers
4. ✅ Inter-agent messages are displayed in the communication flow
5. ✅ Users can filter events by type (UserPromptSubmit, Task assignments)
6. ✅ Users can expand/collapse event details for deeper inspection
7. ✅ Session metadata (duration, agent count, token usage) is prominently displayed

### Performance Requirements
1. ✅ Initial load time < 2 seconds for sessions with up to 1000 events
2. ✅ Smooth scrolling at 60 FPS for timeline navigation
3. ✅ Memory usage < 100MB for typical session viewing
4. ✅ Support for sessions with 50+ agents without degradation

### User Experience Requirements
1. ✅ Intuitive navigation between different sessions
2. ✅ Clear visual hierarchy distinguishing orchestrator vs agent events
3. ✅ Responsive design working on desktop and tablet viewports
4. ✅ Keyboard shortcuts for common navigation actions

## Technical Constraints

1. **Must leverage existing infrastructure**:
   - SQLite database with events and subagent_registry tables
   - WebSocket real-time updates
   - Priority event bucketing system
   
2. **Must reuse existing patterns**:
   - EventTimeline component structure
   - Vue 3 composition API patterns
   - Tailwind CSS styling conventions
   
3. **Must maintain backward compatibility**:
   - No breaking changes to existing APIs
   - Preserve current SubagentComms.vue functionality
   
4. **Performance boundaries**:
   - Maximum 10,000 events per session
   - Virtual scrolling for large datasets
   - Progressive data loading

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Large event datasets causing performance issues | High | Medium | Implement virtual scrolling and pagination |
| Complex query patterns impacting database | Medium | Low | Add appropriate indexes, use query caching |
| UI complexity affecting usability | Medium | Medium | Iterative UX testing, progressive disclosure |
| WebSocket overhead for session replay | Low | Low | Use REST for historical data, WS for real-time only |

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Existing event database schema
- WebSocket infrastructure
- Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS frameworks

### Internal Dependencies
- EventTimeline component patterns
- ChatTranscript display logic
- SubagentComms.vue integration point

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**: 80% of users access introspection view within first week
2. **Performance**: P95 query time < 200ms
3. **Usability**: Users can find specific events within 30 seconds
4. **Reliability**: Zero data loss or corruption in visualization
5. **Satisfaction**: User feedback score > 4.5/5

## Phase Gates

### Entry Criteria
- Architecture documents approved
- Database indexes optimized
- Development environment ready

### Exit Criteria
- All acceptance criteria met
- Performance benchmarks achieved
- Integration tests passing
- User acceptance testing completed
- Documentation updated

## Resource Requirements

### Team Composition
- 2-3 Frontend Engineers (Vue.js expertise)
- 1 Backend Engineer (Database optimization)
- 1 UX Designer (Timeline visualization)
- 1 QA Engineer (Testing strategy)

### Technical Resources
- Development and staging environments
- Performance testing tools
- Browser testing infrastructure

## Timeline

- **Day 1-2**: Backend API implementation
- **Day 2-4**: Frontend component development
- **Day 4-5**: Integration and optimization
- **Day 5-6**: Testing and bug fixes
- **Day 6-7**: Documentation and deployment

## Notes

This phase focuses on read-only introspection of completed sessions. Future phases may add:
- Session comparison features
- Pattern detection and analysis
- Export capabilities
- Real-time session monitoring
