# Phase 11: Priority Event Buckets Implementation

## Executive Summary

This phase implements a dual-bucket event management system that maintains priority events (UserPromptSubmit, Notification, Stop) longer than regular events through intelligent bucket allocation and enhanced retention policies.

## Phase Objectives

### Primary Goal
Implement priority event bucket system that preserves critical events longer while maintaining system performance and backward compatibility.

### Key Deliverables
1. Database schema migration with priority classification
2. Enhanced server-side event retrieval with dual-bucket algorithm  
3. Client-side dual-bucket management with intelligent overflow handling
4. WebSocket protocol enhancements with priority metadata
5. Comprehensive testing and validation framework

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Priority events (UserPromptSubmit, Notification, Stop, SubagentStop) are retained 24 hours vs 4 hours for regular events
- [ ] Client receives mixed priority/regular events up to configured limits (200 priority, 100 regular, 250 total)
- [ ] Priority events are preserved when total limits are exceeded
- [ ] Real-time priority classification and broadcasting works correctly
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained with existing clients

### Performance Requirements  
- [ ] Priority-aware queries execute within 100ms
- [ ] Memory usage stays within acceptable bounds (50MB client-side limit)
- [ ] WebSocket message overhead < 5% increase
- [ ] Database indexes optimize priority-based retrieval

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] 100% test coverage for new priority logic
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Configuration-driven behavior via environment variables

## Business Value

### Immediate Benefits
- **Enhanced Event Analysis**: Critical events preserved longer for debugging and analysis
- **Improved System Observability**: Priority events provide better system state understanding
- **Better User Experience**: Important events remain visible longer in UI

### Long-term Strategic Value
- **Scalable Event Management**: Foundation for advanced event classification and policies
- **Intelligent Retention**: Data-driven retention policies based on event importance
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Priority events support faster issue resolution

## Technical Scope

### Database Layer
- Add priority column to events table with backward-compatible migration
- Create priority-optimized indexes for query performance
- Implement priority calculation logic based on event types
- Add priority metadata field for future extensibility

### Server Layer  
- Enhance insertEvent() with automatic priority classification
- Implement getRecentEventsWithPriority() with intelligent bucket merging
- Update WebSocket broadcasting with priority metadata
- Add configurable retention policies via environment variables

### Client Layer
- Implement dual-bucket event management in useWebSocket composable
- Add priority-aware event display with configurable overflow strategies
- Enhance multi-session event handling for priority classification
- Add priority event indicators and statistics

### Integration Points
- WebSocket protocol enhancement with priority message types
- Environment variable configuration for bucket limits and retention
- Backward compatibility layer for non-priority-aware clients

## Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies
- SaraMatrix's architecture research analysis completed
- PaulLogic's system design and implementation blueprint completed
- Current database schema stable (no pending migrations)
- Existing WebSocket infrastructure operational

### Downstream Dependencies  
- No blocking dependencies for subsequent phases
- Future UI enhancements can leverage priority metadata
- Advanced analytics features can build on priority classification

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Database Migration**: Risk of data corruption or performance degradation
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive backup, staged rollout, rollback procedures
2. **Memory Usage**: Risk of client-side memory leaks with dual buckets
   - Mitigation: Configurable limits, automatic cleanup, monitoring
3. **WebSocket Compatibility**: Risk of breaking existing client connections
   - Mitigation: Backward-compatible protocol, graceful degradation

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Query Performance**: Risk of slower database queries with priority logic
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing, query optimization, performance testing
2. **Configuration Complexity**: Risk of misconfiguration causing data loss
   - Mitigation: Sensible defaults, validation, comprehensive documentation

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- Priority event retention rate: 95%+ of priority events retained for full 24-hour window
- Query performance: <100ms for priority-aware event retrieval
- Memory efficiency: <50MB client-side event storage
- Compatibility: 100% backward compatibility with existing clients

### Qualitative Metrics  
- Zero production incidents during rollout
- Positive feedback on enhanced event visibility
- Successful demonstration of priority event preservation
- Clean, maintainable codebase with comprehensive tests
