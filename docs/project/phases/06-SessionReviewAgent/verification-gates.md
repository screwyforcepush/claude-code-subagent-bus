## Gate Failure Protocol

### If Any Gate Fails:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Stop forward progress
   - Document failure details
   - Notify team and stakeholders

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identify specific failure points
   - Determine impact on timeline
   - Assess resource needs

3. **Resolution Planning**
   - Create fix implementation plan
   - Allocate resources
   - Update timeline if needed

4. **Re-verification**
   - Implement fixes
   - Re-run failed gate checks
   - Obtain approval to proceed
