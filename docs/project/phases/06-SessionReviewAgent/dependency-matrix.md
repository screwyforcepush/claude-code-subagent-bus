```

## Critical Path Analysis

The critical path determines the minimum project duration:

```
WP-03 (3h) → WP-05 (8h) → WP-07 (5h) → WP-10 (4h) → WP-11 (4h) → WP-12 (6h)
Total: 30 hours
```

### Critical Path Visualization
```
     ┌──────┐
     │ WP-03│ 3h
     └───┬──┘
         ▼
     ┌──────┐
     │ WP-05│ 8h  ← Longest task on critical path
     └───┬──┘
         ▼
     ┌──────┐
     │ WP-07│ 5h
     └───┬──┘
         ▼
     ┌──────┐
     │ WP-10│ 4h  ← Convergence point
     └───┬──┘
         ▼
     ┌──────┐
     │ WP-11│ 4h
     └───┬──┘
         ▼
     ┌──────┐
     │ WP-12│ 6h
     └──────┘
```

## Parallelization Opportunities

### Maximum Parallel Efficiency
- **Batch 1**: 3 engineers working simultaneously
- **Batch 2**: 3 engineers with some idle time
- **Batch 3**: 3 engineers fully utilized
- **Batch 4-5**: Sequential by nature

### Resource Optimization
```
Engineer 1: WP-01 → WP-04 → WP-07 → WP-10 → WP-12
Engineer 2: WP-03 → WP-05 → WP-11 → WP-12
Engineer 3: WP-02 → WP-06 → WP-08 → WP-10 → WP-12
QA:         Wait → Wait → WP-09 → WP-10 → WP-12
```

## Dependency Risk Analysis

### High-Risk Dependencies
1. **WP-05 → WP-07**: Review agent must be complete for API
   - Mitigation: Mock data for API development
   
2. **WP-10 Convergence**: Multiple WPs must complete
   - Mitigation: Staggered completion checks

### Low-Risk Dependencies
1. **WP-01/02 → WP-06**: Simple configuration updates
2. **WP-11 → WP-12**: Documentation can start early

## Buffer Allocations

| Critical Path Segment | Buffer | Reason |
|----------------------|--------|--------|
| WP-05 (Review Agent) | +2 hrs | Complex algorithm development |
| WP-10 (Validation) | +1 hr | Multiple integration points |
| WP-12 (Documentation) | +1 hr | Review and approval cycles |

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Early Start Opportunities
- WP-08 can begin UI mockups before WP-07
- WP-09 can write test shells before implementation

### 2. Parallel Review Points
- Code reviews can happen within batches
- Documentation can be drafted incrementally

### 3. Risk Reduction
- Daily standup at batch boundaries
- Continuous integration after each WP

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Point |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Batch 1 Completion | 4 hours | End of Day 1 AM |
| Batch 2 Completion | 8 hours | End of Day 2 AM |
| Batch 3 Completion | 8 hours | End of Day 3 AM |
| Critical Path Progress | On track | Daily |
| Parallel Efficiency | >80% | Per batch |

## Contingency Plans

### If WP-05 Delayed
- Accelerate WP-08 with mocked data
- Begin WP-09 with available components
- Shift resources from WP-04 after completion

### If WP-10 Reveals Issues
- Rapid triage and prioritization
- Parallel fix implementation
- Defer non-critical issues to next phase

## Communication Matrix

| Event | Stakeholders | Timing |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Batch Complete | All team | At boundary |
| Blocker Found | PM + Tech Lead | Immediate |
| WP Complete | Next WP owner | Immediate |
| Daily Status | All team | Standup |
| Phase Complete | All stakeholders | WP-12 done |
