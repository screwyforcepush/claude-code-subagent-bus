# Phase 06: Session Review Agent Implementation

**Phase ID:** 06-SessionReviewAgent  
**Created:** 2025-08-20  
**Status:** Planning  
**Duration Estimate:** 4-5 days  
**Priority:** High  

## Phase Objectives

Implement a Session Review Agent system that intercepts session ID retrieval, injects session context into subagent prompts, and provides AI-powered session analysis capabilities. This feature builds upon the existing hook infrastructure to enable comprehensive session review without modifying core Claude Code functionality.

## Business Value

- **Enhanced Visibility**: Subagents receive session context for better coordination
- **Automated Analysis**: AI-powered session review provides actionable insights
- **Risk Mitigation**: Review agent can block dangerous operations in real-time
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify patterns and bottlenecks across sessions
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated scoring and recommendation generation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. Session ID injection into Task tool prompts works transparently
2. getCurrentSessionId.sh wrapper intercepts and logs session access
3. Review trigger service evaluates sessions based on configurable criteria
4. Session review agent analyzes and scores completed sessions
5. Review results are stored and retrievable via API
6. UI displays session review results with scores and recommendations
7. Manual session ID validation works (8d90abf7-bd33-4367-985c-b5acb886a63a)

### Performance Requirements
1. Hook execution adds <100ms latency to tool calls
2. Review processing runs asynchronously without blocking
3. Session data fetching completes in <500ms
4. Review analysis completes within 10 seconds for typical sessions

### Integration Requirements
1. Seamless integration with existing hook framework
2. No modifications to Claude Code core functionality
3. Compatible with existing observability infrastructure
4. Works with current SubagentComms.vue UI

## Technical Constraints

1. **Must use existing hook mechanisms**:
   - PreToolUse hooks for injection
   - Exit code patterns for blocking
   - JSON input/output protocols
   
2. **Must leverage existing infrastructure**:
   - Session API endpoints
   - SQLite database schema
   - WebSocket connections
   
3. **Must follow established patterns**:
   - Python hook script structure
   - UV script runner usage
   - Configuration in settings.json

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Hook execution failures | High | Low | Graceful fallback, non-blocking design |
| Performance impact on Task calls | Medium | Low | Async processing, timeout protection |
| Complex session analysis accuracy | Medium | Medium | Rule-based initial implementation, AI enhancement later |
| PATH manipulation conflicts | Low | Low | Clear documentation, wrapper script validation |

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Existing hook infrastructure (.claude/hooks/)
- Session API endpoints (localhost:4000)
- SQLite database with events table
- Python 3.8+ with uv package manager

### Internal Dependencies
- Session introspection architecture (Phase 05)
- Existing hook scripts (register_subagent.py, etc.)
- Current settings.json configuration

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: 100% of Task calls receive session ID injection
2. **Performance**: P95 hook latency <100ms
3. **Reliability**: Zero blocking failures in production
4. **Analysis Quality**: Review scores correlate with actual session outcomes
5. **Adoption**: 50% of sessions trigger automatic review within first week

## Phase Gates

### Entry Criteria
- Research and architecture documents reviewed
- Development environment configured
- Test session ID available for validation

### Exit Criteria
- All acceptance criteria met
- Integration tests passing
- Manual validation completed with test session
- Documentation updated
- Team briefed on new capabilities

## Resource Requirements

### Team Composition
- 2 Backend Engineers (Hook implementation)
- 1 Frontend Engineer (UI components)
- 1 QA Engineer (Testing strategy)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (PATH configuration)

### Technical Resources
- Development environment with hook support
- Test sessions for validation
- API testing tools

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Hook infrastructure setup
- **Day 2**: Review agent implementation
- **Day 3**: API and database integration
- **Day 4**: UI components and testing
- **Day 5**: Integration testing and deployment

## Notes

This phase implements the core session review functionality. Future enhancements may include:
- AI-powered analysis using Claude API
- Pattern detection across multiple sessions
- Custom review criteria configuration
- Real-time alerting for critical issues
- Export capabilities for review reports
