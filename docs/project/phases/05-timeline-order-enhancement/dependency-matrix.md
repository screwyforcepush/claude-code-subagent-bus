## Detailed Dependency Analysis

### Inter-WP Dependencies

| Work Package | Depends On | Blocks | Can Parallel With |
|--------------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| WP1: Core Reversal | None | WP3 | WP2 |
| WP2: Visual Polish | None | WP3 | WP1 |
| WP3: Testing | WP1, WP2 | Phase Exit | None |

### File-Level Dependencies

| File | Modified By | Read By | Conflict Risk |
|------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| EventTimeline.vue | WP1 | WP3 | None (WP2 creates new files) |
| EventRow.vue | WP2 | WP3 | Low (minor enhancement) |
| TimelineDirectionHeader.vue | WP2 (new) | WP3 | None (new file) |
| timeline.css | WP2 | WP3 | None (additive changes) |
| *.test.js files | WP3 | - | None |

### External Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Risk | Status |
|------------|------|------|--------|
| Design System Guidelines | Documentation | None | Available |
| Architecture Analysis | Documentation | None | Complete |
| Vue.js Framework | Technical | None | Stable |
| Testing Framework | Technical | None | Configured |
| WebSocket Service | Runtime | None | No changes needed |

## Critical Path Analysis

### Primary Critical Path
```
Start → WP1/WP2 (parallel, 4hrs) → WP3 (3hrs) → Complete
Total Duration: 7 hours
```

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Maximum Parallelization**
   - Run WP1 and WP2 simultaneously
   - Saves 3-4 hours vs sequential execution
   - Requires 2 engineers

2. **Resource Optimization**
   - Single engineer: 10-12 hours (sequential)
   - Two engineers: 6-8 hours (parallel)
   - Efficiency gain: 40-50%

3. **Risk Reduction**
   - No file conflicts between WP1 and WP2
   - Clear boundaries between packages
   - Independent testing possible

## Dependency Risk Matrix

| Risk Scenario | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------------|-------------|--------|------------|
| WP1 breaks existing functionality | Low | High | Incremental testing during development |
| WP2 CSS conflicts with WP1 | Low | Low | Separate CSS namespaces |
| WP3 finds critical issues | Medium | Medium | Early testing, quick feedback loop |
| Browser compatibility issues | Low | Medium | Test in multiple browsers early |

## Coordination Points

### Batch 1 Coordination (WP1 + WP2)
- **Start**: Synchronized kick-off
- **Mid-point**: Check-in on any shared concerns
- **Completion**: Both must finish before WP3 starts
- **Communication**: Via team messaging system

### Batch 2 Coordination (WP3)
- **Start**: After WP1 and WP2 merge
- **During**: Report issues immediately to original implementers
- **Completion**: Full verification before phase exit

## Resource Allocation Strategy

### Optimal Assignment
```
Engineer A (Senior): WP1 - Critical path, core functionality
Engineer B (Mid): WP2 - Visual enhancements, UX polish
Designer: Support for WP2 (advisory, 1-2 hours)
Gatekeeper: WP3 - Testing and verification
```

### Alternative Assignments
```
Option 1 (Speed Priority):
- 2 Senior Engineers on WP1+WP2
- Complete in 3-4 hours total

Option 2 (Learning Priority):
- Junior + Senior pair on WP1
- Mid-level solo on WP2
- Knowledge transfer benefit

Option 3 (Minimal Resources):
- 1 Engineer does WP1 → WP2 → WP3
- 10-12 hours total duration
```

## Verification Points

### Pre-Batch Verification
- [ ] EventTimeline.vue is current version
- [ ] Design guidelines are finalized
- [ ] Test environment is ready
- [ ] Engineers have required access

### Inter-Batch Verification
- [ ] WP1 changes committed and tested locally
- [ ] WP2 changes committed and tested locally
- [ ] No merge conflicts between packages
- [ ] Both packages ready for integration

### Post-Batch Verification
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Visual review complete
- [ ] Performance metrics validated
- [ ] Ready for production deployment

## Notes on Dependency Management

1. **No Backend Dependencies**: This phase is purely frontend, reducing complexity
2. **No Database Dependencies**: No data model changes required
3. **No API Dependencies**: WebSocket interface remains unchanged
4. **Minimal File Conflicts**: WP1 and WP2 work on mostly different files
5. **Clear Handoffs**: WP3 has clear inputs from WP1 and WP2

This dependency structure enables maximum parallelization while maintaining clear boundaries and minimal risk of conflicts.
