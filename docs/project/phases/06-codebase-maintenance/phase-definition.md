# Phase 06: Codebase Maintenance and Organization

## Phase Overview

**Phase ID:** 06-codebase-maintenance  
**Duration:** 3 weeks (estimated)  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** None (can start immediately)

## Objectives

1. **File Organization**: Reorganize misplaced files into proper directory structure
2. **Documentation Optimization**: Transform README.md into navigational hub (150-200 lines)
3. **Script Consolidation**: Move test scripts to appropriate locations
4. **Quality Gate Cleanup**: Eliminate duplicate reports and consolidate test results
5. **Git History Preservation**: Maintain version control integrity during moves

## Acceptance Criteria

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero test/documentation files in root directory (except CLAUDE.md and README.md)
- [ ] README.md reduced to 150-200 lines serving as navigation hub
- [ ] All test scripts organized in proper directories with updated imports
- [ ] No duplicate quality gate reports across codebase
- [ ] All automated tests passing after reorganization
- [ ] Build and dev server functioning correctly
- [ ] Git history preserved for all moved files
- [ ] Clear documentation of new file locations

### Verification Gates
1. **Pre-Implementation Gate**: Backup branch created, all current tests passing
2. **Mid-Phase Gate**: File moves complete, import paths updated
3. **Final Gate**: All systems operational, documentation updated

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Breaking Imports**: Moving files may break existing import statements
   - **Mitigation**: Systematic import path updates, comprehensive testing
   
2. **Script Dependencies**: Scripts may have hardcoded paths
   - **Mitigation**: Full script audit before moves, test all scripts after

3. **Git History Loss**: Improper moves could fragment history
   - **Mitigation**: Use `git mv` exclusively, verify history preservation

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Documentation Links**: Internal links may break
   - **Mitigation**: Link validation after moves
   
2. **CI/CD Impact**: Build processes may reference old paths
   - **Mitigation**: Review and update CI/CD configurations

## Phase Timeline

### Week 1: Critical Cleanup
- Days 1-2: File reorganization (WP-01, WP-02, WP-03)
- Days 3-4: Import path updates and testing (WP-04)
- Day 5: Verification and fixes

### Week 2: Documentation Optimization  
- Days 1-2: README restructuring (WP-05)
- Days 3-4: Documentation extraction and guide creation (WP-06, WP-07)
- Day 5: Link validation and cross-references (WP-08)

### Week 3: Final Polish
- Days 1-2: App-level documentation updates (WP-09)
- Days 3-4: Script documentation and validation tools (WP-10)
- Day 5: Final verification and team handoff

## Success Indicators

1. Developer feedback: "Much easier to navigate the codebase"
2. Time to find files reduced by 50%
3. New developer onboarding time reduced by 30%
4. Zero broken imports or scripts
5. Clean git status with organized structure

## Team Collaboration Points

- **Engineers**: Execute file moves and import updates
- **Gatekeepers**: Verify all functionality preserved
- **Architect**: Validate new structure aligns with architecture
- **Designer**: Ensure UI documentation properly organized

## Phase Completion Definition

Phase is complete when:
1. All files reorganized per plan
2. All tests passing
3. All scripts functional
4. Documentation updated and validated
5. Team trained on new structure
6. Backup branch archived for safety
