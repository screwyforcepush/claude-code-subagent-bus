## Resource Allocation

### Optimal Team Composition

#### Core Team (Days 1-5)
1. **Senior Engineer**: WP01 → WP03 → WP06 (Critical path owner)
2. **Backend Engineer**: WP02 → WP04 → WP08
3. **Full-Stack Engineer**: WP05 → WP07
4. **Documentation Engineer**: WP09 → WP10

#### Support Team (As needed)
1. **Architect**: Design consultation (2-4 hours/day)
2. **DevOps Engineer**: CI/CD setup (Day 4-5)
3. **QA Engineer**: Test strategy (Day 3-5)

### Parallel Execution Efficiency

| Day | Active WPs | Engineers | Utilization |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | WP01, WP02 | 2 | 100% |
| 2 | WP01, WP02, WP03, WP04, WP05 | 3-4 | 100% |
| 3 | WP03, WP04, WP05, WP06 | 3-4 | 100% |
| 4 | WP06, WP07, WP08, WP09 | 4 | 100% |
| 5 | WP07, WP08, WP09, WP10 | 4 | 100% |
| 6 | WP10, WP11 | 2 | 50% |
| 7 | WP11 | 1 | 25% |

**Average Utilization**: 82%
**Peak Parallelization**: 4 engineers (Days 4-5)

## Risk-Adjusted Schedule

### Buffer Allocation
- **Batch 1**: +4 hours buffer (critical foundation)
- **Batch 2**: +8 hours buffer (external dependency)
- **Batch 3**: +4 hours buffer (integration complexity)
- **Batch 4**: +8 hours buffer (quality gates)
- **Batch 5**: +2 hours buffer (documentation)
- **Batch 6**: +4 hours buffer (release process)

### Contingency Plans

#### If GitHub API Issues (WP03)
1. Switch to tar.gz archive approach
2. Implement raw file fetching
3. Add 1 day to timeline

#### If Cross-Platform Failures (WP04)
1. Focus on Unix first, Windows second
2. Document platform limitations
3. Add platform-specific patches

#### If Test Coverage Low (WP07)
1. Extend timeline by 0.5 days
2. Reduce coverage target to 85%
3. Plan follow-up improvement phase
