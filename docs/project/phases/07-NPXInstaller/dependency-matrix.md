# Dependency Matrix - Phase 07: NPX Installer

## Dependency Overview

This matrix shows the relationships between work packages and identifies the critical path for phase execution.

## Work Package Dependencies

| WP ID | Work Package | Depends On | Enables | Parallel With | Critical Path |
|-------|-------------|------------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| WP01 | NPM Package Setup | None | WP03, WP05, WP06 | WP02 | ✓ |
| WP02 | Core Infrastructure | None | WP03, WP04, WP05 | WP01 | ✓ |
| WP03 | GitHub API Integration | WP02 | WP06, WP07 | WP04, WP05 | ✓ |
| WP04 | File Writer Module | WP02 | WP06, WP07 | WP03, WP05 | ✓ |
| WP05 | CLI Interface | WP01, WP02 | WP06, WP07 | WP03, WP04 | |
| WP06 | Installation Orchestrator | WP03, WP04, WP05 | WP07, WP08, WP09, WP10, WP11 | None | ✓ |
| WP07 | Unit Testing Suite | WP03, WP04, WP05 | WP11 | WP08, WP09 | |
| WP08 | Integration & E2E Testing | WP06 | WP11 | WP09, WP10 | |
| WP09 | Documentation | WP06 | WP10, WP11 | WP08, WP10 | |
| WP10 | Publishing Preparation | WP09 | WP11 | WP08, WP09 | |
| WP11 | Final Verification & Release | All | None | None | ✓ |

## Dependency Types

### Hard Dependencies (Blocking)
- **WP06 → WP03, WP04, WP05**: Orchestrator requires all core modules
- **WP08 → WP06**: E2E tests require complete flow
- **WP11 → All**: Final verification requires everything complete

### Soft Dependencies (Beneficial)
- **WP07 → WP03, WP04, WP05**: Can write test stubs early but needs implementation for full testing
- **WP09 → WP06**: Can start documentation early but needs working system for accuracy
- **WP10 → WP09**: Publishing benefits from complete documentation

### No Dependencies (Can Start Immediately)
- **WP01**: NPM Package Setup
- **WP02**: Core Infrastructure

## Critical Path Analysis

```
Critical Path (6 steps):
START → WP01/WP02 → WP03/WP04 → WP06 → WP08 → WP11 → END

Duration: ~6-7 days
```

### Critical Path Breakdown
1. **Day 1**: WP01 + WP02 (parallel foundation)
2. **Day 2**: WP03 + WP04 (parallel core features)
3. **Day 3**: WP06 (integration point)
4. **Day 4**: WP08 (verification)
5. **Day 5-6**: WP11 (final gate)

### Non-Critical Paths
- WP05 can slip 1 day without impacting critical path
- WP07 can run parallel to WP08
- WP09 and WP10 can complete after WP08

## Parallelization Matrix

### Maximum Parallel Execution

| Batch | Work Packages | Max Parallel Engineers | Dependencies Met |
|-------|--------------|------------------------|------------------|
| 1 | WP01, WP02 | 2 | None required |
| 2 | WP03, WP04, WP05 | 3 | WP01, WP02 |
| 3 | WP06 | 1 | WP03, WP04, WP05 |
| 4 | WP07, WP08, WP09 | 3 | WP06 |
| 5 | WP10 | 1 | WP09 |
| 6 | WP11 | 1 | All |

### Optimal Resource Allocation

```
Engineers Assignment:
- Engineer 1: WP01 → WP03 → WP06 → WP11
- Engineer 2: WP02 → WP04 → WP07
- Engineer 3: WP05 → WP08
- Engineer 4: WP09 → WP10
- Support: Architect consultation throughout
```

## Risk Mitigation Through Dependencies

### Identified Risks

1. **GitHub API Changes**
   - Impact: WP03
   - Mitigation: WP02 error handling provides fallback

2. **Cross-Platform Issues**
   - Impact: WP04, WP06
   - Mitigation: WP02 platform utilities abstract differences

3. **Testing Bottleneck**
   - Impact: WP07, WP08
   - Mitigation: Start WP07 early with stubs

4. **Documentation Lag**
   - Impact: WP09, WP10
   - Mitigation: WP09 can start with WP06 partial completion

## Dependency Resolution Order

### Forward Schedule (Earliest Start)
1. Start: WP01, WP02
2. After WP01: WP05
3. After WP02: WP03, WP04
4. After WP03+WP04+WP05: WP06
5. After WP06: WP07, WP08, WP09
6. After WP09: WP10
7. After all: WP11

### Backward Schedule (Latest Start)
1. WP11 must complete by Day 7
2. WP08 must complete by Day 6
3. WP06 must complete by Day 4
4. WP03, WP04 must complete by Day 3
5. WP01, WP02 must complete by Day 2

## Inter-Phase Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies
- Research synthesis document (Complete)
- Architecture design document (Complete)
- ADR-001 decisions (Complete)
- Testing strategy document (Complete)

### Downstream Impact
- No subsequent phases blocked
- Package can be updated independently
- Future phases can assume NPX installer availability
