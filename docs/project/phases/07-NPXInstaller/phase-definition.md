# Phase 07: NPX Installer Package Implementation

## Phase Overview

This phase implements an NPX-installable package (`@claude-code/setup-installer`) that enables users to quickly install the Claude multi-agent orchestration setup into their projects with a single command.

## Phase Objectives

1. **Create NPM Package**: Establish the `@claude-code/setup-installer` package structure with proper configuration
2. **Implement GitHub Integration**: Build robust file fetching from the repository using GitHub APIs
3. **Build CLI Interface**: Create intuitive command-line interface with progress indicators
4. **Installation Logic**: Implement file installation with conflict resolution and rollback capabilities
5. **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive testing covering unit, integration, and E2E scenarios
6. **Documentation & Publishing**: Prepare package for npm registry publication

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Users can install Claude setup with: `npx @claude-code/setup-installer`
- Successfully fetches and installs `.claude` directory from GitHub repository
- Successfully fetches and installs `CLAUDE.md` file
- Handles existing files with user-configurable strategies (skip/overwrite/backup)
- Creates `settings.local.json` from template with default values
- Provides clear progress feedback during installation
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Installation completes in under 30 seconds for typical setup
- Package size remains under 5MB
- Handles GitHub API rate limits gracefully with fallback mechanisms
- Provides clear, actionable error messages
- Maintains 90% test coverage

### Technical Requirements
- Node.js 18+ compatibility
- Uses GitHub Trees API for efficient directory fetching
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Supports offline caching for repeated installations
- Follows npm best practices for CLI packages

## Phase Timeline

**Estimated Duration**: 5-7 days

### Milestones
1. **Day 1-2**: Package setup and core infrastructure (WP01, WP02)
2. **Day 2-3**: GitHub integration and file fetching (WP03, WP04)
3. **Day 3-4**: CLI implementation and installation logic (WP05, WP06)
4. **Day 4-5**: Testing suite implementation (WP07, WP08)
5. **Day 5-6**: Documentation and publishing preparation (WP09, WP10)
6. **Day 6-7**: Verification and release (WP11)

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- GitHub API availability
- npm registry access for publishing
- Test directory: `claude-comms-dummy-project-for-test-install`

### Internal Dependencies
- Research synthesis document (completed)
- Architecture design document (completed)
- ADR-001 design decisions (completed)
- Testing strategy document (completed)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **GitHub API Rate Limiting**
   - Mitigation: Implement caching and fallback to raw URLs
   
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive CI testing matrix
   
3. **Network Reliability**
   - Mitigation: Retry logic with exponential backoff

### Operational Risks
1. **npm Package Naming Conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Use scoped package name `@claude-code/setup-installer`
   
2. **Version Management**
   - Mitigation: Semantic versioning with clear changelog

## Success Metrics

1. **Installation Success Rate**: >95% successful installations
2. **Performance**: <30 second installation time
3. **Test Coverage**: >90% code coverage
4. **User Satisfaction**: Clear error messages and recovery options
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works on all major operating systems

## Team Collaboration Points

1. **Architecture Review**: Validate GitHub API approach with architect
2. **Testing Coordination**: Align test scenarios with gatekeeper requirements
3. **Documentation Review**: Ensure README aligns with project standards
4. **Publishing Process**: Coordinate npm registry access and publication

## Phase Completion Gates

1. All work packages completed and verified
2. Test coverage meets 90% threshold
3. Successful E2E tests on all platforms
4. Documentation reviewed and approved
5. Package successfully published to npm registry
6. Installation verified in `claude-comms-dummy-project-for-test-install`
