# Dependency Matrix - Phase 10: Matrix Mode

## Dependency Overview

This matrix identifies all dependencies between work packages and optimizes for maximum parallel execution. Green paths indicate parallel work, yellow indicates partial dependencies, and red indicates blocking dependencies.

## Detailed Dependency Matrix

| Work Package | Depends On | Enables | Can Parallel With | Blocking |
|-------------|------------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **WP1: State Management** | None | WP4, WP5 | WP2, WP3, Support | No |
| **WP2: Canvas Renderer** | None | WP6 | WP1, WP3, Support | No |
| **WP3: Character System** | None | WP4 | WP1, WP2, Support | No |
| **WP4: Event Transform** | WP1 (state), WP3 (chars) | WP5, WP6 | WP5 (partial), Support | Partial |
| **WP5: WebSocket** | WP1 (state), WP4 (transform) | WP6 | Support | Partial |
| **WP6: Optimization** | WP2 (canvas), WP4 (data), WP5 (realtime) | Complete | Support | Yes |
| **Support-A: Testing** | Following each WP | Quality gates | All WPs | No |
| **Support-B: Docs** | Following implementation | User guides | All WPs | No |

## Dependency Types

### 🟢 No Dependencies (Immediate Start)
- **WP1**: State Management - Pure composable creation
- **WP2**: Canvas Renderer - Standalone component
- **WP3**: Character System - Asset and utility creation

### 🟡 Soft Dependencies (Partial Blocking)
- **WP4**: Needs WP1's state structure and WP3's character definitions
  - Can begin interface design immediately
  - Full implementation after WP1/WP3 complete
- **WP5**: Needs WP1's state and WP4's transformation
  - Can begin WebSocket setup immediately
  - Integration after WP4 delivers

### 🔴 Hard Dependencies (Full Blocking)
- **WP6**: Requires working canvas (WP2), data flow (WP4), and real-time updates (WP5)
  - Cannot begin until prerequisites complete
  - Critical path item

## Optimization Strategies

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

#### Batch 1: Maximum Parallelization (3 engineers)
```
Time 0: Start simultaneously
- Engineer A → WP1 (State Management)
- Engineer B → WP2 (Canvas Renderer) 
- Engineer C → WP3 (Character System)
```

#### Batch 2: Smart Sequencing (2 engineers)
```
Time 1: After WP1 & WP3 complete
- Engineer D → WP4 (Event Transform)
- Engineer A → Assists WP4

Time 1.5: After WP4 delivers interface
- Engineer E → WP5 (WebSocket Integration)
- Engineer C → Assists WP5
```

#### Batch 3: Convergence (1-2 engineers)
```
Time 2: After WP2, WP4, WP5 complete
- Engineer F → WP6 (Optimization)
- Engineer B → Assists WP6
```

### Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Path**: WP1 → WP4 → WP5 → WP6

**Path Duration**: 
- WP1: 4-6 hours
- WP4: 6-8 hours (can start partially early)
- WP5: 4-6 hours (can start partially early)
- WP6: 6-8 hours
- **Total Critical Path**: 20-28 hours (2.5-3.5 days)

**Non-Critical Paths**:
- WP2: 6-8 hours (parallel)
- WP3: 4-6 hours (parallel)

## Risk Mitigation Through Dependencies

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Early Interface Definition**
   - WP4 and WP5 can define interfaces before dependencies complete
   - Reduces waiting time by 2-3 hours

2. **Partial Implementation**
   - WP4 can implement transformation logic without full state
   - WP5 can set up WebSocket handling without transformers

3. **Mock Development**
   - WP6 can begin with mock data while WP5 completes
   - Allows performance baseline establishment

4. **Support Work Buffer**
   - Testing and documentation provide buffer tasks
   - Engineers can switch to support work if blocked

## Dependency Communication Protocol

### Handoff Points

#### WP1 → WP4/WP5
**Deliverables Required**:
- State interface definitions
- Toggle event emitters
- Config structure

**Communication**: Direct API documentation and types

#### WP3 → WP4
**Deliverables Required**:
- Character set exports
- Mapping functions
- Effect definitions

**Communication**: Utility function library

#### WP4 → WP5
**Deliverables Required**:
- Transform function
- Drop data structure
- Event filters

**Communication**: Integration interface

#### WP2/4/5 → WP6
**Deliverables Required**:
- Working canvas renderer
- Event stream connected
- Basic animation loop

**Communication**: Full integration test

## Parallel Execution Rules

### Can Execute in Parallel
✅ Different components (WP1 Toggle vs WP2 Canvas)
✅ Different layers (WP2 Rendering vs WP3 Assets)
✅ Support work with any implementation
✅ Testing following completed work

### Cannot Execute in Parallel
❌ Same file modifications (avoid conflicts)
❌ Dependent data flows (WP4 needs WP1 state)
❌ Integration before components (WP6 needs all)
❌ Optimization before implementation

## Success Metrics for Dependency Management

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Parallel Utilization**: >75% of engineers active simultaneously
- **Blocking Time**: <10% of total engineering time
- **Handoff Delays**: <1 hour per dependency
- **Rework Due to Dependencies**: <5% of effort

### Quality Metrics
- **Interface Stability**: No breaking changes after handoff
- **Integration Issues**: <3 per batch
- **Dependency Documentation**: 100% complete
- **Communication Clarity**: No misunderstandings

## Dependency Escalation

### Escalation Triggers
1. Dependency delayed >2 hours
2. Interface changes required
3. Blocking issue discovered
4. Performance impact from integration

### Escalation Path
1. Engineer → Team broadcast
2. Team → Architect consultation
3. Architect → Orchestrator decision
4. Orchestrator → Re-planning if needed
