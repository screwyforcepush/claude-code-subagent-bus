### Total: 8 engineers working in parallel batches

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Canvas Performance**: Mitigated by WP6 optimizations and WebGL fallback
- **Memory Management**: Object pooling in WP6, limits in WP5
- **Browser Compatibility**: Continuous testing in WP-Support-A

### Schedule Risks
- **Integration Delays**: WP4-5 have minimal dependencies, can partially parallelize
- **Performance Issues**: WP6 dedicated to optimization with buffer time
- **Quality Gates**: Support work runs parallel, not blocking
