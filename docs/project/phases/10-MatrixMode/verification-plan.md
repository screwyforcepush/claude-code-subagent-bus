## Testing Procedures

### Functional Testing

#### Test Case 1: Basic Toggle
```
1. Load EventTimeline component
2. Locate Matrix mode toggle button
3. Click toggle button
4. Verify mode switches to Matrix
5. Click toggle again
6. Verify mode returns to normal
Expected: Smooth transitions, no errors
```

#### Test Case 2: Real-time Events
```
1. Enable Matrix mode
2. Generate new WebSocket events
3. Observe Matrix rain updates
4. Verify events appear as drops
5. Check character mapping accuracy
Expected: Events render within 50ms
```

#### Test Case 3: Performance Under Load
```
1. Enable Matrix mode
2. Generate 1000 simultaneous events
3. Monitor FPS counter
4. Check memory usage
5. Verify no degradation
Expected: Maintains 60fps
```

### Performance Testing

#### Benchmark 1: Frame Rate
```javascript
// Run for 60 seconds with varying load
const benchmark = {
  duration: 60000,
  events: [100, 500, 1000, 2000],
  measure: ['fps', 'frameTime', 'droppedFrames']
};
```

#### Benchmark 2: Memory Usage
```javascript
// Monitor memory over 30 minutes
const memoryTest = {
  duration: 1800000,
  interval: 5000,
  measure: ['heapUsed', 'heapTotal', 'external']
};
```

#### Benchmark 3: CPU Usage
```javascript
// Profile CPU during active use
const cpuProfile = {
  duration: 300000,
  scenarios: ['idle', 'normal', 'heavy'],
  measure: ['usage', 'idle', 'system']
};
```

### Visual Testing

#### Visual Regression Suite
1. **Capture Baselines**
   - Normal mode appearance
   - Matrix mode initial state
   - Matrix mode with events
   - Transition states
   - Error states

2. **Comparison Points**

   - Character appearance
   - Effect rendering
   - Color accuracy

3. **Diff Tolerance**
   - Layout: 0% difference
   - Colors: < 5% difference
