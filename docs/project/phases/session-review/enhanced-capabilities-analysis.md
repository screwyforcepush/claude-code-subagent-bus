## Data Quality Assessment

### Current System Limitations

| Component | Status | Issue Identified |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| API Server | ✅ Operational | No connectivity issues |
| Session Storage | ⚠️ Unknown | Sessions exist but empty |
| Event Collection | ❌ Failing | Zero events captured |
| Agent Registry | ❌ Failing | Zero agents recorded |
| Message System | ❌ Failing | Zero messages stored |

### Data Collection Gap Analysis

**Root Cause Hypotheses:**
1. **Timing Issue:** Data collection may only activate during specific session phases
2. **Configuration Gap:** Event capture hooks may not be properly configured
3. **Storage Pipeline:** Event data may be generated but not persisted
4. **Session State:** Both sessions may be in non-data-capturing states

**Diagnostic Priority:**
1. Investigate event hook configuration and activation
2. Examine session lifecycle and data capture timing
3. Validate storage pipeline integrity
4. Test data collection with known active sessions

## Advanced Pattern Recognition

### Empty Dataset Patterns
Despite empty datasets, valuable patterns emerge:

**Pattern 1: Consistent Emptiness**
- Both current and historical sessions show identical empty structure
- Suggests systematic rather than random data collection failure
- Indicates infrastructure-level issue rather than session-specific problems

**Pattern 2: API Structural Integrity**
- All expected API response fields present with correct data types
- Session IDs properly validated and returned
- Suggests data collection issue occurs downstream from API layer

**Pattern 3: Timestamp Precision**
- Both sessions have precise fetch timestamps (1755742775818, 1755742776289)
- Indicates API layer processing correctly but data layer empty
- Points to event capture or storage layer issues
