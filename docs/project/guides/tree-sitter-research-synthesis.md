# Tree-Sitter Research Synthesis: Patterns, Algorithms, and Optimization

## Executive Summary

This research provides comprehensive analysis of tree-sitter usage patterns, graph ranking algorithms for code importance, and token limiting strategies for large codebases. Key findings include sophisticated AST parsing techniques, NetworkX-based PageRank implementations, and multi-level optimization strategies that enable real-time code analysis at scale.

**Key Recommendations:**
- Implement multi-language tree-sitter parsing with .scm query patterns
- Use PageRank with personalization for code importance ranking
- Apply binary search optimization for token budget allocation
- Employ hierarchical caching strategies for performance
- Leverage incremental parsing for real-time applications

## Tree-Sitter Integration Patterns

### Core Architecture Pattern
Tree-sitter provides incremental parsing with 36x speedup over traditional parsers, generating Concrete Syntax Trees (CSTs) that preserve exact source code structure. The key pattern involves:

1. **Language-Agnostic Parsing**: Use py-tree-sitter-languages for uniform interface across 25+ languages
2. **Query-Based Symbol Extraction**: Leverage .scm files with S-expression patterns for definitions/references
3. **Caching Strategy**: Implement file hash-based cache invalidation with mtime validation
4. **Error Recovery**: Handle incomplete/malformed code through tree-sitter's error recovery

### Symbol Extraction Best Practices

**Query Pattern Structure:**
```scm
; Function definitions
(function_definition
  name: (identifier) @function.name) @function.definition

; References in call expressions  
(call
  function: (identifier) @function.reference)
```

**Multi-Language Handling:**
- Abstract language differences through unified symbol model
- Maintain per-language .scm queries for consistent extraction
- Use named fields and explicit node paths to avoid overmatching
- Test with canonical code samples for each language

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Batch symbol extraction queries to minimize overhead
- Use incremental parsing for changed regions only
- Cache parsed trees with content-based checksums
- Implement selective analysis for large monorepos

## Graph Ranking Algorithms for Code Importance

### PageRank Implementation for Code Dependencies

**Core Algorithm:**
```python
def pagerank_code_graph(dependencies, personalization=None, damping=0.85):
    """
    dependencies: dict mapping symbols to their dependencies
    personalization: dict of nodes to boost (e.g., recently edited files)
    """
    import networkx as nx
    
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    for definer, deps in dependencies.items():
        for dep in deps:
            G.add_edge(dep, definer)  # dep -> definer relationship
    
    return nx.pagerank(G, alpha=damping, personalization=personalization)
```

**Weight Assignment Strategies:**
- **Uniform weighting**: All edges treated equally (baseline)
- **Frequency-based**: Weight by call/reference frequency
- **Type-based**: inheritance=3, function-call=2, import=1
- **Context-aware**: Boost weights for chat files (50x multiplier)

### Alternative Centrality Measures

| Measure | Code Interpretation | Use Case |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| **Betweenness** | Bridge/connector modules | Identify critical dependencies |
| **Closeness** | Core modules easily reached | Find central architecture components |
| **Eigenvector** | Connected to important nodes | Recursive importance like PageRank |
| **In/Out-degree** | Direct dependency count | Simple dependency metrics |

**Implementation Patterns:**
- Use NetworkX for prototyping, switch to graph-tool for production scale
- Handle dangling nodes (no outlinks) with uniform rank redistribution
- Apply sparse matrices for memory efficiency on large graphs
- Implement parallel computation for enterprise-scale codebases

## Token Limiting and Optimization Strategies

### Binary Search Optimization

**Algorithm for Token Budget Allocation:**
```python
def find_max_content(chunks, token_budget, tokenizer):
    """Binary search to find maximum content within token budget"""
    low, high = 0, len(chunks)
    best_size = 0
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        content = assemble_chunks(chunks[:mid])
        token_count = tokenizer.count_tokens(content)
        
        if token_count <= token_budget:
            best_size = mid
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return chunks[:best_size]
```

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Pre-tokenize chunks to avoid repeated computation
- Use skip lists for very large chunk sets
- Apply 15% error tolerance for convergence speed
- Cache token counts per content hash

### Multi-Level Caching Strategy

**Hierarchical Cache Design:**
1. **L1 - Memory Cache**: Recently accessed ASTs and token counts
2. **L2 - Disk Cache**: Serialized parse trees with mtime validation  
3. **L3 - Database Cache**: Symbol mappings and rankings (SQLite/diskcache)

**Cache Key Strategy:**
```python
def cache_key(file_path, content_hash, query_type):
    return f"{file_path}:{content_hash}:{query_type}"
```

**Invalidation Rules:**
- File modification time changes -> invalidate file caches
- Dependency graph changes -> invalidate ranking caches
- Query pattern updates -> invalidate symbol extraction caches

### Adaptive Sampling for Large Files

**Context Prioritization Levels:**
1. **Level 1**: Direct symbols (functions/classes in focus)
2. **Level 2**: Related declarations (called functions, types)
3. **Level 3**: Wider context (imports, docstrings)
4. **Level 4**: Background context (unrelated code)

**Sampling Strategies:**
- **Importance-based**: Rank by PageRank scores and static analysis
- **Stratified**: Ensure representation across file sections
- **Sliding windows**: Adaptive overlap based on query relevance
- **Summary-first**: Generate summaries for excluded sections
