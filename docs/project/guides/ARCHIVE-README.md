# Legacy Documentation Archive

This directory contains archived documentation from the multi-agent observability system development process. These files represent point-in-time snapshots of features, architectures, and specifications that have been consolidated into the current 8 core guides.

## Archive Contents

### Architecture Documentation
- **ADR files**: Architectural Decision Records for historical context
- **Feature architectures**: Specific feature design documents
- **Implementation guides**: Detailed technical implementation notes

### Research & Analysis
- **Research synthesis**: Technology evaluation and selection rationale
- **Investigation reports**: Deep-dive analysis of system components
- **Performance studies**: Optimization research and findings

### Design System Evolution
- **Timeline component**: Evolution of the timeline visualization system
- **UI patterns**: Component design and interaction patterns
- **Design tokens**: Historical design system specifications

### Implementation History
- **Matrix mode**: Advanced visualization feature development
